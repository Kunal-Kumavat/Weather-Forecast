SQL Queries Answers - 

1. Give the count of the minimum number of days for the time when temperature reduced?
Ans- 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS days
FROM(
SELECT D_date, minimum_temperature
FROM cleaned_file_weather_prediction
WHERE minimum_temperature < (SELECT avg(minimum_temperature) FROM cleaned_file_weather_prediction)
) SQ;


2. Find the temperature as Cold / hot by using the case and avg of values of the given data set?
Ans-- 
SELECT D_date, temperature AS daily_avg_temp,
AVG(Temperature) Over (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM D_DATE), EXTRACT(YEAR FROM D_date)) AS monthly_avg_temp,
CASE
WHEN temperature >= AVG(Temperature) OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM D_date), EXTRACT(YEAR FROM D_date ))
THEN 'HOT'
ELSE 'COLD'
END AS temp_status
FROM cleaned_file_weather_prediction
GROUP BY D_date
ORDER BY D_date;


3. Can you check for all 4 consecutive days when the temperature was below 30 Fahrenheit?
Ans-- 
WITH table1 AS
(SELECT *, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY D_date) AS ROW_ID
FROM cleaned_file_weather_prediction), table2 AS
(SELECT D_date, Temperature, ROW_ID,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY D_date) AS ROW_NUM,
ROW_ID - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY D_date) AS diff FROM table1
WHERE Temperature < 30), T3 AS 
(SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY diff) AS conc_days FROM table2)
SELECT D_date, Temperature FROM T3 WHERE conc_days = 4;


4. Can you find the maximum number of days for which temperature dropped?
Ans--
WITH daily_temp_change AS(
SELECT D_date, Temperature AS daily_temp, LAG(Temperature) OVER (ORDER BY D_date) AS last_temp
FROM cleaned_file_weather_prediction
)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_days
FROM daily_temp_change
WHERE daily_temp < last_temp;


5. Can you find the average of average humidity from the dataset?
Ans-- 
SELECT D_date , AVG (Average_humidity) AS Average_humidity
FROM cleaned_file_weather_prediction
GROUP BY D_date
ORDER BY D_date;


6. Use the GROUP BY clause on the Date column and make a query to fetch details for average windspeed ( which is now windspeed done in task 3 )?
Ans--
SELECT D_date, AVG(Average_windspeed) AS avg_windspeed
FROM cleaned_file_weather_prediction
GROUP BY D_date
ORDER BY D_date;


7. Please add the data in the dataset for 2034 and 2035 as well as forecast predictions for these years?
Ans--
WITH RECURSIVE table1 AS
(SELECT D_date, Temperature, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY D_DATE) AS ROW_NUM 
FROM cleaned_file_weather_prediction ),
table2 AS 
(SELECT slope, y_bar_max - x_bar_max * slope AS intercept
FROM
(SELECT
SUM ((ROW_NUM - x_bar) * (Temperature - y_bar)) / SUM ((ROW_NUM - x_bar) * (ROW_NUM - x_bar)) AS slope,
MAX(x_bar) AS x_bar_max,
MAX(y_bar) AS y_bar_max
FROM
(SELECT ROW_NUM, AVG(ROW_NUM) OVER() AS x_bar,
Temperature, AVG(Temperature) OVER() AS y_bar
FROM table1) data1
) data2)
SELECT prediction_data.D_date,
ROUND ((prediction_data.ROW_NUM * (SELECT slope FROM table2) * (SELECT intercept FROM table2)), 2) AS predict_temperature
FROM prediction_data;


8. If the maximum gust speed increases from 55mph, fetch the details for the next 4 days?
Ans--
SELECT wd.D_date, wd.MAX_GUSTSPEED
FROM cleaned_file_weather_prediction wd
INNER JOIN (SELECT D_date FROM cleaned_file_weather_prediction WHERE MAX_GUSTSPEED >55 ) sub
ON wd.D_date BETWEEN sub.D_date AND D_date_ADD(sub.D_date, INTERVAL 4 DAY );


9. Find the number of days when the temperature went below 0 degrees Celsius?
Ans--
SELECT COUNT(*) No_of_days
FROM cleaned_file_weather_prediction
WHERE Temperature < 32;


10. Create another table with a “Foreign key” relation with the existing given data set.?
Ans--
CREATE TABLE new(
avg_temp int NOT NULL,
Average_humidity int ,
Average_dewpoint int,
D_date date,
PRIMARY KEY (avg_temp),
FOREIGN KEY (D_date) REFERENCES cleaned_file_weather_prediction(D_date)
);
